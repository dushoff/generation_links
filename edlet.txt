Dear Editors:

We were advised by Dr.~Heesterbeek to not submit a cover letter with this resubmission, but the electronic system is not OK with that.

We are also not sure why the submission system will not let us submit our article without a "highlights" file. Somewhere on the Elsevier site we found instructions for optional highlights, but we are not sure whether these apply in this case, or whether highlights are really required (we did not need them for our previous submission of this manuscript).

We have uploaded a placeholder file. Please let us know if this is a problem.
