Dear Editor:

We were invited to comment on our submission 27-08-2018-ISRA-eLife-41495, which was not sent for review on the grounds of being too theoretical.

In fact, the core of the paper involves techniques that are routinely applied to disease data, and an attempt to make the implications and interpretation of such results more clear. Figures 3 and 5 show examples of how the model fits data from Ebola and rabies outbreaks. Figure 4 (measles) is also based on data from outbreaks, but given the wide range of data available, it wasn't completely clear how to presentably show it in the graph.

We have slightly edited the paper, focusing on the figures, to highlight the data that are already present. We can also do a larger revision to address your concerns, if you think you might be interested in reviewing the submission.

Thank you very much,

Jonathan Dushoff (for the authors)
