Dear Editor:

Please accept the enclosed MS, "Exploring how generation intervals link strength and speed of epidemics", for consideration for publication in Epidemics.

This article addresses what we feel is an important gap. Modelers and policy-makers studying infectious-disease outbreaks are very interested in epidemic speed (r, the rate of exponential growth) and strength (R, the reproductive number). There is an understanding that these are linked by generation intervals and moment-generating functions, but little qualitative (or even quantitative) understanding of how these links operate.

Our article discusses how to approximate the r-R relationship using estimates about the mean and coefficient of variation of the generation interval. We explain qualitative reasons why longer, and less variable, generation intervals lead to higher estimates of R for a given value of r, and discuss and apply a range of simple approximations to three examples based on infectious disease outbreaks: Ebola virus disease, measles, and rabies.

The ideas and explications in this article have the potential to provide intuitive understanding to help scientists and policy-makers navigate difficult questions around predicting and controlling infectious diseases.

Thank you for your consideration of our submission.
